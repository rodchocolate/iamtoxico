# Creative and Design

Artwork
- Source: tshirt_sample_proportional.png (4500x5400 @ 200dpi, sRGB)

Variants
- Placement: small L chest (~3.5" wide), large center (~11.5" wide).
- Garment colors: black, bone, heather grey; assess contrast.
- Colorways: original, inverted, 1 accent (toxic green).

Mockups
- Use Printify mockup generator; export clean hero images for PDP and socials.

File prep
- Naming: iamtoxico_<design>_<placement>_<colorway>_4500x5400.png
- Bleed/margins: follow supplier spec; avoid edges.

QC checklist
- No background pixels, crisp edges.
- sRGB profile embedded.
- Lint-free large area prints to avoid boxy DTG.
