# Homepage Brief — iamtoxico (Shopify: Dawn)

Goals
- Introduce brand voice; drive clicks to Underwear Capsule and first capsule tees.
- Capture emails and build social proof.

IA / Sections
1) Hero: waistband macro (EN/ES copy); CTA: Shop Underwear / Join Waitlist.
2) Monthly Drop banner: “2 colors/month. then gone.”
3) Featured products: 4–8 (mix thong/boxers/tee).
4) Brand strip: “soft but not not sweet / cómodo pero no dulce” (toggle EN/ES).
5) Editorial: vintage PD image + short blurb (credit in footer).
6) Social proof: UGC carousel / TikTok embed.
7) Newsletter: bilingual capture (tag source).
8) Footer: policies, contact, attribution for PD images if used.

Assets needed
- Logo + favicon set, OG image 1200x630, hero banners (desktop/mobile), product stills (PDP crops), vertical clips.
- Size guide graphics (Underwear & Tees), returns/exchange graphic, trust badges.

Copy blocks (draft)
- EN: “underwear that clashes on purpose. ‘i love toxico’ / ‘i am toxico’. handle with care.”
- ES: “ropa interior que choca a propósito. ‘i love toxico’ / ‘i am toxico’. handle with care.”

SEO
- Title: iamtoxico — casual + lounge with an edge.
- Meta: monthly drops, bilingual brand, comfort + design.

Next
- Approve sections and copy; I’ll convert this into a page checklist + image specs by slot.
