# TikTok Playbook — iamtoxico (Bilingual + ZIP targeting)

Goals

- Interests: Streetwear, Fashion & Style, Lingerie, Fitness, Festival/EDM.
- Retargeting: site (ViewContent, ATC), 7–30 day windows.

- Budget: $20–$50/ad group/day to start; scale 20–30%/day on winners.

- Couple POV: “clash on purpose.” / “choquen a propósito.”
- Color clash carousel: month stamp.
- Try-on/fit check; comfort + waistband macro.
